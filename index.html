<p>Bio:  Hi, I’m Davon Randolph I’m a master trainer with 10+ years of training experience, a degree in exercise science and a passion for helping others improve their lives through fitness.</p>
<p>My fitness journey began in 2016, driven by a simple love for working out. What started as a passion for exercise evolved into a deeply rewarding career. I graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 2018 with a Bachelor’s in Exercise Science, fueling my commitment to helping others achieve their health goals.(Picture of me)</p>

<p>With over a decade of experience, I’ve worked with hundreds of clients, guiding them toward weight loss, improved mobility, and a deeper understanding of their wellness needs. The joy of empowering others to feel, look, and perform better is what keeps me energized—it never gets old.  My PRIMARY focus is delivering personalized, results-driven coaching so that you can live the life you deserve. (Picture of me)</p>
